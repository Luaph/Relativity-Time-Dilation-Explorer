# Gravitational Time Dilation Calculator

## Overview
This is my very first project on github It's a **C program** that calculates gravitational time dilation the effect predicted by Einstein’s theory of General Relativity where time passes more slowly in strong gravitational fields

Given:
- **r** → distance from the center of the massive object (in meters)
- **M** → mass of the object (in kilograms)

1 = There is no distortion due to gravity.
0 = This is the boundary at the event horizon of a black hole (Schwarzschild radius).


the program represent this équation :
\[
t = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{r c^2}}
\]
